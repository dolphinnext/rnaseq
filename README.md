[![Travis-ci tests:](https://travis-ci.org/dolphinnext/rnaseq.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dolphinnext/rnaseq) [![DOI:10.1101/689539](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.1101/689539.svg)](https://doi.org/10.1101/689539)

RNA-seq pipeline includes Quality Control, rRNA filtering, Genome Alignment using HISAT2, STAR and Tophat2, and estimating gene and isoform expression levels by RSEM and featureCounts. 
Alternatively, Kallisto could be used for quantifying abundances of transcripts based on pseudoalignments, without the need for alignment.
  
##### Steps:
  1. For Quality Control, we use FastQC to create qc outputs. There are optional read quality filtering (trimmomatic), read quality trimming (trimmomatic), adapter removal (cutadapt) processes available.
  2. Bowtie2/Bowtie/STAR is used to count or filter out common RNAs (eg. rRNA, miRNA, tRNA, piRNA etc.). 
  3. RSEM is used to align RNA-Seq reads to a reference transcripts and estimates gene and isoform expression levels. Alternatively, Kallisto used for quantifying abundances of transcripts based on pseudoalignments.
  4. HISAT2, STAR and Tophat2 are used to align RNA-Seq reads to a genome. Optionally, counting reads to genomic features such as genes, exons, promoters and genomic bins could be done by featureCounts.
  5. Genome-wide Bam analysis is done by RseQC, Picard.
  6. Optionally you can create Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)  and Genome Browser Files (TDF and Bigwig, respectively)
