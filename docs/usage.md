# dolphinnext/rnaseq: Usage

## Introduction
Nextflow handles job submissions on SLURM or other environments, and supervises running the jobs. Thus the Nextflow process must run until the pipeline is finished. We recommend that you put the process running in the background through `screen` / `tmux` or similar tool. Alternatively you can run nextflow within a cluster job submitted your job scheduler.

It is recommended to limit the Nextflow Java virtual machines memory. We recommend adding the following line to your environment (typically in `~/.bashrc` or `~./bash_profile`):

```bash
NXF_OPTS='-Xms1g -Xmx4g'
```

## Running the pipeline
The typical command for running the pipeline is as follows:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -profile docker --DOWNDIR /path/to/save/genome-data --reads '*_R{1,2}.fastq.gz' --genome_build mouse_mm10_refseq
```

This will launch the pipeline with the `docker` configuration profile. See below for more information about profiles.

Note that the pipeline will create the following files in your working directory:

```bash
work            # Directory containing the nextflow working files
results         # Finished results 
.nextflow_log   # Log file from Nextflow
```

### Updating the pipeline
When you run the above command, Nextflow automatically pulls the pipeline code from GitHub and stores it as a cached version. When running the pipeline after this, it will always use the cached version. In order to download latest version of the pipeline you need to run following command:

```bash
nextflow pull nf-core/rnaseq
```

## Main arguments

### `-profile`
Use this parameter to choose a configuration profile. Profiles can give configuration presets for different compute environments. Note that multiple profiles can be loaded, for example: `-profile docker, test` - the order of arguments is important!

If `-profile` is not specified at all the pipeline will be run locally and expects all software to be installed and available on the `PATH`.

* `docker`
  * A generic configuration profile to be used with [Docker](http://docker.com/)
  * Pulls software from Dockerhub: [`nfcore/rnaseq`](http://hub.docker.com/r/nfcore/rnaseq/)
* `singularity`
  * A generic configuration profile to be used with [Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov/)
  * Pulls software from DockerHub
* `test`
  * A profile with a complete configuration for automated testing
  * You need to download sample fastq files and define those reads as a input parameter:

### `--reads`
Use this to specify the location of your input FastQ files. For example:

```bash
--reads 'path/to/data/sample_*_{1,2}.fastq'
```

Please note the following requirements:

1. The path must be enclosed in quotes
2. The path must have at least one `*` wildcard character
3. When using the pipeline with paired end data, the path must use `{1,2}` notation to specify read pairs.

If left unspecified, a default pattern is used: `data/*{1,2}.fastq.gz`

### `--singleEnd`
By default, the pipeline expects paired-end data. If you have single-end data, you need to specify `--singleEnd` on the command line when you launch the pipeline. A normal glob pattern, enclosed in quotation marks, can then be used for `--reads`. For example:

```bash
--singleEnd --reads '*.fastq'
```

It is not possible to run a mixture of single-end and paired-end files in one run.

### Library strandedness
Three command line flags / config parameters set the library strandedness for a run:

* `--forward_stranded`
* `--reverse_stranded`
* `--unstranded`

If not set, the pipeline will be run as unstranded. Specifying `--pico` makes the pipeline run in `forward_stranded` mode.

You can set a default in a cutom Nextflow configuration file such as one saved in `~/.nextflow/config` (see the [nextflow docs](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html) for more). For example:

```nextflow
params {
    reverse_stranded = true
}
```

If you have a default strandedness set in your personal config file you can use `--unstranded` to overwrite it for a given run.

These flags affect the commands used for several steps in the pipeline - namely HISAT2, featureCounts, RSeQC (`RPKM_saturation.py`) and StringTie:

* `--forward_stranded`
  * HISAT2: `--rna-strandness F` / `--rna-strandness FR`
  * featureCounts: `-s 1`
  * RSeQC: `-d ++,--` / `-d 1++,1--,2+-,2-+`
  * StringTie: `--fr`
* `--reverse_stranded`
  * HISAT2: `--rna-strandness R` / `--rna-strandness RF`
  * featureCounts: `-s 2`
  * RSeQC: `-d +-,-+` / `-d 1+-,1-+,2++,2--`
  * StringTie: `--rf`

## FeatureCounts Extra Gene Names

### Default Attribute Type

By default, the pipeline uses `gene_name` as the default gene identifier group. In case you need to adjust this, specify using the option `--fcGroupFeatures` to use a different category present in your provided GTF file. Please also take care to use a suitable attribute to categorize the `biotype` of the selected features in your GTF then, using the option `--fcGroupFeaturesType` (default: `gene_biotype`).

### Extra Gene Names
By default, the pipeline uses `gene_names` as additional gene identifiers apart from ENSEMBL identifiers in the pipeline.
This behaviour can be modified by specifying `--fcExtraAttributes` when running the pipeline, which is passed on to featureCounts as an `--extraAttributes` parameter.
See the user guide of the [Subread package here](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/subread-package/SubreadUsersGuide.pdf).
Note that you can also specify more than one desired value, separated by a comma:
``--fcExtraAttributes gene_id,...``


## Alignment tool
By default, the pipeline uses [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) to align the raw FastQ reads to the reference genome. STAR is fast and common, but requires a lot of memory to run, typically around 38GB for the Human GRCh37 reference genome.

If you prefer, you can use [HISAT2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml) as the alignment tool instead. Developed by the same group behind the popular Tophat aligner, HISAT2 has a much smaller memory footprint.

To use HISAT2, use the parameter `--aligner hisat2` or set `params.aligner = 'hisat2'` in your config file.

## Reference genomes

The pipeline config files come bundled with paths to the illumina iGenomes reference index files. If running with docker or AWS, the configuration is set up to use the [AWS-iGenomes](https://ewels.github.io/AWS-iGenomes/) resource.

### `--genome` (using iGenomes)
There are 31 different species supported in the iGenomes references. To run the pipeline, you must specify which to use with the `--genome` flag.

You can find the keys to specify the genomes in the [iGenomes config file](../conf/igenomes.config). Common genomes that are supported are:

* Human
  * `--genome GRCh37`
* Mouse
  * `--genome GRCm38`
* _Drosophila_
  * `--genome BDGP6`
* _S. cerevisiae_
  * `--genome 'R64-1-1'`

> There are numerous others - check the config file for more.

Note that you can use the same configuration setup to save sets of reference files for your own use, even if they are not part of the iGenomes resource. See the [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html) for instructions on where to save such a file.

The syntax for this reference configuration is as follows:

```nextflow
params {
  genomes {
    'GRCh37' {
      star    = '<path to the star index folder>'
      fasta   = '<path to the genome fasta file>' // Used if no star index given
      gtf     = '<path to the genome gtf file>'
      bed12   = '<path to the genome bed file>' // Generated from GTF if not given
    }
    // Any number of additional genomes, key is used with --genome
  }
}
```

### `--star_index`, `--hisat2_index`, `--fasta`, `--gtf`, `--bed12`
If you prefer, you can specify the full path to your reference genome when you run the pipeline:

```bash
--star_index '[path to STAR index]' \
--hisat2_index '[path to HISAT2 index]' \
--fasta '[path to Fasta reference]' \
--gtf '[path to GTF file]' \
--bed12 '[path to bed12 file]'
```

Note that only one of `--star_index` / `--hisat2_index` are needed depending on which aligner you are using (see below).

The minimum requirements are a Fasta and GTF file. If these are provided and no others, then all other reference files will be automatically generated by the pipeline.

### `--saveReference`
Supply this parameter to save any generated reference genome files to your results folder.
These can then be used for future pipeline runs, reducing processing times.

### `--saveTrimmed`
By default, trimmed FastQ files will not be saved to the results directory. Specify this
flag (or set to true in your config file) to copy these files when complete.

### `--saveAlignedIntermediates`
As above, by default intermediate BAM files from the alignment will not be saved. The final BAM files created after the Picard MarkDuplicates step are always saved. Set to true to also copy out BAM files from STAR / HISAT2 and sorting steps.

## Adapter Trimming
If specific additional trimming is required (for example, from additional tags),
you can use any of the following command line parameters. These affect the command
used to launch TrimGalore!

### `--clip_r1 [int]`
Instructs Trim Galore to remove bp from the 5' end of read 1 (or single-end reads).

### `--clip_r2 [int]`
Instructs Trim Galore to remove bp from the 5' end of read 2 (paired-end reads only).

### `--three_prime_clip_r1 [int]`
Instructs Trim Galore to remove bp from the 3' end of read 1 _AFTER_ adapter/quality trimming has been performed.

### `--three_prime_clip_r2 [int]`
Instructs Trim Galore to re move bp from the 3' end of read 2 _AFTER_ adapter/quality trimming has been performed.


## Library Prep Presets
Some command line options are available to automatically set parameters for common RNA-seq library preparation kits.

> Note that these presets override other command line arguments. So if you specify `--pico --clip_r1 0`, the `--clip_r1` bit will be ignored.

If you have a kit that you'd like a preset added for, please let us know!

### `--pico`
Sets trimming and standedness settings for the _SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit - Pico Input_ kit.

Equivalent to: `--forward_stranded` `--clip_r1 3` `--three_prime_clip_r2 3`


## Skipping QC steps
The pipeline contains a large number of quality control steps. Sometimes, it may not be desirable to run all of them if time and compute resources are limited.
The following options make this easy:

* `--skip_qc` -                Skip **all QC steps**, apart from MultiQC
* `--skip_fastqc` -            Skip FastQC
* `--skip_rseqc` -             Skip RSeQC
* `--skip_genebody_coverage` - Skip calculating the genebody coverage
* `--skip_preseq` -            Skip Preseq
* `--skip_dupradar` -          Skip dupRadar (and Picard MarkDups)
* `--skip_edger` -             Skip edgeR MDS plot and heatmap
* `--skip_multiqc` -           Skip MultiQC

## Job resources
### Automatic resubmission
Each step in the pipeline has a default set of requirements for number of CPUs, memory and time. For most of the steps in the pipeline, if the job exits with an error code of `143` (exceeded requested resources) it will automatically resubmit with higher requests (2 x original, then 3 x original). If it still fails after three times then the pipeline is stopped.

### Custom resource requests
Wherever process-specific requirements are set in the pipeline, the default value can be changed by creating a custom config file. See the files hosted at [`nf-core/configs`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/tree/master/conf) for examples.

If you are likely to be running `nf-core` pipelines regularly it may be a good idea to request that your custom config file is uploaded to the `nf-core/configs` git repository. Before you do this please can you test that the config file works with your pipeline of choice using the `-c` parameter (see definition below). You can then create a pull request to the `nf-core/configs` repository with the addition of your config file, associated documentation file (see examples in [`nf-core/configs/docs`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/tree/master/docs)), and amending [`nfcore_custom.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/blob/master/nfcore_custom.config) to include your custom profile.

If you have any questions or issues please send us a message on [`Slack`](https://nf-core-invite.herokuapp.com/).

## AWS Batch specific parameters
Running the pipeline on AWS Batch requires a couple of specific parameters to be set according to your AWS Batch configuration. Please use the `-awsbatch` profile and then specify all of the following parameters.
### `--awsqueue`
The JobQueue that you intend to use on AWS Batch.
### `--awsregion`
The AWS region to run your job in. Default is set to `eu-west-1` but can be adjusted to your needs.

Please make sure to also set the `-w/--work-dir` and `--outdir` parameters to a S3 storage bucket of your choice - you'll get an error message notifying you if you didn't.


## Other command line parameters

### `--outdir`
The output directory where the results will be saved.

### `--email`
Set this parameter to your e-mail address to get a summary e-mail with details of the run sent to you when the workflow exits. If set in your user config file (`~/.nextflow/config`) then you don't need to specify this on the command line for every run.

### `-name`
Name for the pipeline run. If not specified, Nextflow will automatically generate a random mnemonic.

This is used in the MultiQC report (if not default) and in the summary HTML / e-mail (always).

**NB:** Single hyphen (core Nextflow option)

### `-resume`
Specify this when restarting a pipeline. Nextflow will used cached results from any pipeline steps where the inputs are the same, continuing from where it got to previously.

You can also supply a run name to resume a specific run: `-resume [run-name]`. Use the `nextflow log` command to show previous run names.

**NB:** Single hyphen (core Nextflow option)

### `-c`
Specify the path to a specific config file (this is a core NextFlow command).

**NB:** Single hyphen (core Nextflow option)

Note - you can use this to override pipeline defaults.

### `--custom_config_version`
Provide git commit id for custom Institutional configs hosted at `nf-core/configs`. This was implemented for reproducibility purposes. Default is set to `master`.

```bash
## Download and use config file with following git commid id
--custom_config_version d52db660777c4bf36546ddb188ec530c3ada1b96
```

### `--custom_config_base`
If you're running offline, nextflow will not be able to fetch the institutional config files
from the internet. If you don't need them, then this is not a problem. If you do need them,
you should download the files from the repo and tell nextflow where to find them with the
`custom_config_base` option. For example:

```bash
## Download and unzip the config files
cd /path/to/my/configs
wget https://github.com/nf-core/configs/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip

## Run the pipeline
cd /path/to/my/data
nextflow run /path/to/pipeline/ --custom_config_base /path/to/my/configs/configs-master/
```

> Note that the nf-core/tools helper package has a `download` command to download all required pipeline
> files + singularity containers + institutional configs in one go for you, to make this process easier.

### `--max_memory`
Use to set a top-limit for the default memory requirement for each process.
Should be a string in the format integer-unit. eg. `--max_memory '8.GB'`

### `--max_time`
Use to set a top-limit for the default time requirement for each process.
Should be a string in the format integer-unit. eg. `--max_time '2.h'`

### `--max_cpus`
Use to set a top-limit for the default CPU requirement for each process.
Should be a string in the format integer-unit. eg. `--max_cpus 1`

### `--hisatBuildMemory`
Required amount of memory in GB to build HISAT2 index with splice sites.
The HiSAT2 index build can proceed with or without exon / splice junction information.
To work with this, a very large amount of memory is required.
If this memory is not available, the index build will proceed without splicing information.
The `--hisatBuildMemory` option changes this threshold. By default it is `200GB` - if your system
`--max_memory` is set to `128GB` but your genome is small enough to build using this, then you can
allow the exon build to proceed by supplying `--hisatBuildMemory 100GB`

### `--subsampFilesizeThreshold`
This parameter defines the threshold in BAM file size (in bytes) at which data subsampling is used prior to the RSeQC `gene_body_coverage` step. This step is done to speed up and reduce compute resources for the gene body coverage analysis .
For very large files this means, that the BAM file will be subsampled to compute the `gene_body_coverage`, for small files there will not be a subsampling step.
By default this parameter is set to `10000000000` - ten gigabytes.

### `--sampleLevel`
Used to turn of the edgeR MDS and heatmap. Set automatically when running on fewer than 3 samples.

### `--plaintext_email`
Set to receive plain-text e-mails instead of HTML formatted.

### `--monochrome_logs`
Set to disable colourful command line output and live life in monochrome.

### `--multiqc_config`
Specify a path to a custom MultiQC configuration file.

## Stand-alone scripts
The `bin` directory contains some scripts used by the pipeline which may also be run manually:

* `gtf2bed`
  * Script used to generate the BED12 reference files used by RSeQC. Takes a `.gtf` file as input
* `dupRadar.r`
  * dupRadar script used in the _dupRadar_ pipeline process.
* `edgeR_heatmap_MDS.r`
  * edgeR script used in the _Sample Correlation_ process
